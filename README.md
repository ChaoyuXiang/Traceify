## Project Description
https://docs.google.com/document/d/18EIdx1Ytu0IXqTDAZWKWwrnbv4uQwJ7OXPdo-ErhpIc/edit?usp=sharing <br/>
*	 Project Description: Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. (try to address all points below)
*	Who is it for?
    - The general public.
*	What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)
    - It will keep track of COVID19 positive individuals of where they have visited in 3  day intervals. 
*	What type of data will it store?
    - Dates and Location of where people who turned out positive visited for the last 3 days
    - Location: (use Google API to get the address)
    - Table (Carecard# primary key, name, address) , Table (carecard#, location, date, time), Vancouver (), Burnaby (), North Vancouver
*	What will users be able to do with this data?
    - View map, locations, and infected numbers per location visited
    - Filter out by location or date
*	What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?
    - Symptom checker: Upon clicking radio buttons, the javascript or library package would calculate whether you would need to go to a clinic for check up or not. 

###	 Project task requirements:
Project Requirements:
Must be completed with your group before workshop 2

*	3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
    - Admin panel: Admin can submit patient data to be stored on database
    - Q&A page
    - Symptom Checker page
    - Location of testing centres - list and map
    - Google Maps integration to show map data based on the filter selected
*	3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)
    - Financial Benefits page (links to CERB, EI, BC Emergency Workers fund, etc.)
    - Wait times of testing centres (employ same technology currently used in all major hospitals: see http://www.edwaittimes.ca/WaitTimes.aspx)
*	2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete 1!)
*	 Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!
    - Current geolocation data only visible to Admin: alerts if the person moves out of their neighbourhood
    - Credit card statement parsing for areas visited by a patient who tested positive, and automatically upload this data to the database
*	 This will help you divide up work among your teammates
*	 Finally, draw 2-3 rough sketch prototypes of some key tasks of your app. Sketch these physically on paper and then scan and add to your repo.

## Project Progress after Workshop 1

*	 Must have a repo in github which all group members can access and send us the link on slack. (See instructions “How to hand in” below.)
*	In order to create a repo, you will need to decide on a project name

How to hand in:
Put all of the writing (Project Description, Project Task requirements, task breakdown), as well as your prototypes into the README of your project repo. Send the repo link to your lab TAs in a slack channel along with your group members. ALSO, for each team member, go on slack and edit your profile. In the “What I do” space, put your team name!
