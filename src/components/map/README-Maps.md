# How to set up your Google Maps API key :smile:

## First things first...

You can follow this tutorial, but I'm not sure how accurate it is: [link](https://elfsight.com/blog/2018/06/how-to-get-google-maps-api-key-guide/).

You will need to sign up for a Google Cloud account and you will need to have a billing account, which means you need to input your credit card. Don't worry, it's basically free unless you make more than 1000 requests.

After you get your api key, copy and replace ``123456`` with your key in the file ``.env`` which is located in the root folder. I have added it to the git ignore file after pushing it the first time so you shouldn't need to worry about sharing this private key for now.

 **DISCLAIMER**: I know this is not safe, but until we have our backend up and running, this will do.

... And if you've set it up correctly, it should run!
