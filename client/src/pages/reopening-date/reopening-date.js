    <b>Disclaimer</b>
    <br />
    Each province and territory have several phases or stages that consist of
    unique policies.
    <br />
    As the COVID-19 cases improves, the province/territory will transition into
    the next phase.
    <br />
    eg. 1 goes to 2 and 2 goes to 3, etc.
    <br />
    However, if the COVID-19 cases worsens, it is possible to regress to a
    previous phase.
    <br />
    eg. 2 reverts to 1.
    <br />
    Each of these phases are flexible to change according to the COVID-19
    climate. Ontario, Quebec, Nunvaut, New Brunswick, Manitoba are not updated.
    <br />
    If there is a service you do not see, try checking the previous stages.
    <br />
    There are additional information listed at the button of the table.
    <br />
    Please call the specific store location of interest to enquire about
    operating hours. Their hours may have adjusted. They could be closed for
    safety.
