      <br />
      Each province and territory have several phases or stages that consist of
      unique policies.
      <br />
      As the COVID-19 cases improves, the province/territory will transition
      into the next phase.
      <br />
      eg. 1 goes to 2 and 2 goes to 3, etc.
      <br />
      However, if the COVID-19 cases worsens, it is possible to regress to a
      previous phase.
      <br />
      eg. 2 reverts to 1.
      <br />
      Each of these phases are flexible to change according to the COVID-19
      climate. Only the Canadian province British Columbia has been updated.
      <br />
      If there is a service you do not see, try checking the previous stages.
      <br />
      There are additional information listed at the button of the table.
      <br />
      Please call the specific store location of interest to enquire about
      operating hours. Their hours may have adjusted. They could be closed for
      safety.
